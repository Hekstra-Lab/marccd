# marccd  
Read, write, and manipulate diffraction images that use the MarCCD format

## Installation

I have not yet made this package available on PyPI. Until then, `marccd` can be
installed locally by cloning the repository and using the included `setup.py`:

```
git clone https://github.com/Hekstra-Lab/marccd.git
cd mdtools
python setup.py install
```
