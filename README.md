Read, write, and manipulate diffraction images that use the MarCCD format

This Python library provides:
- A `MarCCD` class for representing diffraction images and their header information
- IO methods that support reading and writing MarCCD format diffraction images

## Installation

I have not yet made this package available on PyPI. Until then, `marccd` can be
installed locally by cloning the repository and using the included `setup.py`:

```
git clone https://github.com/Hekstra-Lab/marccd.git
cd mdtools
python setup.py install
```
